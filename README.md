## Reflection

This was a 3 month long project built during my time at Scrimba Frontend Career Camp. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features. 

I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` and `styled-components`. 

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, React-Router and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
